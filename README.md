Steps to run this project:
---------------------------

Step:1 -> git clone https://github.com/harith-bechkam/Credit-Card-Form.git

Step:2 -> Go inside the project in terminal and run "yarn install" command
  
  It will take more than 3-4 mins bcoz I'm using eslint,core-js,node-sass libraries

Step:3 -> Once packages installed,run "yarn start"

Step:4 -> The project will run in https://localhost:3000



I have deployed my project in netlify

In this project I used these 2 libraries only
 
 1.react-transition-group
 2.node-sass

I have put my full effort in this 2 days to build this project :)
